# README
 This README file provides an overview of the DTW Accelerated CUDA for PyTorch project.
 The project focuses on accelerating Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) using CUDA for PyTorch.
 
### Key components:
 - Data: Includes datasets such as ECG, METAL, and others that require further exploration.
 - Testing: Ensures consistency and supports distributed training with CUDA and PyTorch modules.
 
### Additional references:
 - University of California Riverside Suite: Contains binary file IO tuned versions relevant to the project.
